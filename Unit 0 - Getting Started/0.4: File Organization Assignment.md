# File Organization Assignment
You will be setting up your ICD2O1c-Spring-2024 GitHub repository for the semester in this assignment. This will allow you to further familiarize yourself with GitHub and stay organized. You will create a folder for each unit where all your subfolders and files will be stored for the respective unit. You should already have the Unit 0 folder completed with one file in it named *0.3 Intro to GitHub.txt*. You have some choice in this, but it must be organized.
**You may be required to demonstrate your file organization for a grade at various points throughout the semester.**

## Folder & File Structure
Below is a sample showing the folders you will need for each unit in this course. We will add subfolders and files to each unit folder as we progress through the course. Since you cannot create a folder without a file in it, use a default file named: README.md and leave it blank. You may delete this file later.
